<p>&lt;span&gt;Responsive design adjusts sizes&lt;/span&gt;<br />&lt;span&gt;For mobile and odd-sized devices&lt;/span&gt;<br />&lt;span&gt;To optimize fit&lt;/span&gt;<br />&lt;span&gt;Move content a bit&lt;/span&gt;<br />&lt;span&gt;Save your users from ugly surprises&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;span&gt;Page layout before Flexbox was hard&lt;/span&gt; <br />&lt;span&gt;Aligning divs left strong coders scarred&lt;/span&gt; <br />&lt;span&gt;Though purists may scoff&lt;/span&gt; <br />&lt;span&gt;Designs one pixel off&lt;/span&gt; <br />&lt;span&gt;Were presented as being &lt;span lang="fr"&gt;avant-garde&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;span&gt;Most semantic design is unseen&lt;/span&gt; <br />&lt;span&gt;Unless you're a web crawling machine&lt;/span&gt;<br />&lt;span&gt;But semantics aid&lt;/span&gt; <br />&lt;span&gt;The SEO trade&lt;/span&gt; <br />&lt;span&gt;Add value (if you know what they mean)&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;span&gt;There's a B.A. in Graphic Design&lt;/span&gt;<br />&lt;span&gt;Who, for his life, can't draw a straight line&lt;/span&gt;<br />&lt;span&gt;Fresh out of school&lt;/span&gt;<br />&lt;span&gt;He thought he was cool&lt;/span&gt;<br />&lt;span&gt;But his prospects are fast in decline&lt;/span&gt;</p>
