      <p>
        For the first time in their modern history, the Chicago Cubs have
        unveiled a new mascot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mascot, named <q>Clark,</q> will make his first appearance Monday
        night in a private visit with children at Advocate Illinois Masonic
        Medical Centerâ€™s Pediatric Developmental Center. Clark will be
        accompanied by more than a dozen Cubs prospects participating in the
        Rookie Development Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mascot was unveiled after the Cubs reviewed surveys and fan
        interviews that conveyed the need for more family-friendly
        entertainment. The comments included the introduction of an official
        mascot who works in the community and embraces young fans.
