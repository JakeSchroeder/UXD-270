              is Georges Seurat's most famous work. It is a leading example of
              pointillist technique, executed on a large canvas. Seurat's
              composition includes a number of Parisians at a park on the banks
              of the River Seine.

              The painting was first exhibited at the eighth (and last)

              Indépendants, of which Seurat had been a founder in 1884. Seurat
              was extremely disciplined, always serious, and private to the
              point of secretiveness—for the most part, steering his own steady
              course. As a painter, he wanted to make a difference in the
              history of art and with La Grand Jatte, succeeded.

              Nighthawks is a 1942 oil on canvas painting by Edward Hopper that
              portrays people in a downtown diner late at night as viewed
              through the diner's large glass window. Also portrayed are the
              exteriors of the urban structures across the street from the
              diner.

            <br />
            <p class="Gal__FigCapP">
              It has been described as Hopper's best-known work and is one of
              the most recognizable paintings in American art. Within months of
              its completion, it was sold to the Art Institute of Chicago on May
              13, 1942 for $3,000.

            <p class="Gal__FigCapP">
              The scene was supposedly inspired by a diner (since demolished) in
              Greenwich Village, Hopper's neighborhood in Manhattan. Hopper
              himself said the painting "was suggested by a restaurant on
              Greenwich Avenue where two streets meet." Additionally, he noted
              that "I simplified the scene a great deal and made the restaurant
              bigger."
