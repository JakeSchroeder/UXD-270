          also be available with zero sugar.

        <blockquote>
          “Watermelon is a truly transportive taste, evoking feelings of freedom
          and nostalgia,” says Nicole Portwood, vice president of marketing at
          Mtn Dew. “We found watermelon to be the number one choice of flavors
          tested amongst our fans, and MTN DEW Major Melon is our answer for
          those who are looking for a refreshing charge to keep them invigorated
          all day long.”

          Both the regular and zero sugar beverages come in 20-ounce bottles,
          2-liter bottles, 12-packs of 12 oz. cans and other single and

          The last permanent flavor Mountain Dew introduced was the
          citrus-flavored White Out in 2010.
