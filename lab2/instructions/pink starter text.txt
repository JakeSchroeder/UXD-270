Mountain Dew has unveiled its first new permanent flavor in more than a decade.

Mtn Dew Major Melon will give soda fans a watermelon flavor, and will also be available with zero sugar.

“Watermelon is a truly transportive taste, evoking feelings of freedom and nostalgia,” says Nicole Portwood, vice president of marketing at Mtn Dew. “We found watermelon to be the number one choice of flavors tested amongst our fans, and MTN DEW Major Melon is our answer for those who are looking for a refreshing charge to keep them invigorated all day long.”

Both the regular and zero sugar beverages come in 20-ounce bottles, 2-liter bottles, 12-packs of 12 oz. cans and other single and multipack sizes. The new flavor is available at retailers and online.

The last permanent flavor Mountain Dew introduced was the citrus-flavored White Out in 2010.

Mountain Dew is the No. 1 flavored carbonated soft drink in the U.S.
